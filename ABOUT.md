ABOUT

This app creates a website of all of the dance events happening in paris each week. 
The script week_of_dance_events.py gathers information from an aggragator. It places the results into an airtable. 
The html/css builds a webpage by fetching the info from the airtable. 

Next steps: I want to create versions of the week_of_dance_events.py for each of the venues listed in venues.md
